1. exchanges
    The core idea in the messaging model in RabbitMQ is that the producer never sends any messages
    directly to a queue. Actually, quite often the producer doesn't even known if a message will be
    deliverd to any queue at all.

    Instead, the producer can only send messages to an exchange. An exchange is a very simple thing.
    On one side it receives messages from producers and the other side it pushes them to queues. The
    exchange must know exactly what to do with a message it receives. Should it be appended to a
    particular queue? Should it be appended to many queues?The rules for that are defined by the exchange type.

    there are a few exhange types available: direct, topic, headers, fanout. We'll focus on the last one -- fanout.
